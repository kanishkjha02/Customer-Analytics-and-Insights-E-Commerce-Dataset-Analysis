## **Tasks Overview**

### **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights**
- **Objective**: Analyze the dataset to uncover meaningful insights.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Kanishk_Jha_EDA.pdf`: Summarizes key findings from the EDA process.
  - `Kanishk_Jha_EDA.ipynb`: Contains detailed code, visualizations, and analysis.

### **Task 2: Lookalike Model**
- **Objective**: Build a model to recommend 3 similar customers for a given customer based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Kanishk_Jha_Lookalike.csv`: A mapping of customer IDs to their top 3 lookalike recommendations with similarity scores.
  - `Kanishk_Jha_Lookalike.ipynb`: Contains code for the lookalike model development.

### **Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
- **Objective**: Segment customers into clusters based on their profile and transaction data.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index).
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Kanishk_Jha_Clustering.pdf`: Summarizes clustering results, including DB Index and cluster characteristics.
  - `Kanishk_Jha_Clustering.ipynb`: Contains code for clustering and visualizations.

## **Results Summary**

### **Task 1: EDA and Business Insights**
- Derived 5 actionable business insights from the EDA process.
- Visualized data distributions and relationships to uncover key patterns.

### **Task 2: Lookalike Model**
- Built a recommendation model using similarity metrics to find lookalike customers.
- Delivered recommendations for the first 20 customers with high-quality similarity scores.

### **Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
- Performed clustering using the K-Means algorithm.
- Determined optimal clusters based on DB Index (best value: 1.16 for 9 clusters).
- Visualized clusters using PCA for better interpretability.
